## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, Iâ€™m Vignesh, a second-year BTech student in Computer Science Engineering with a keen interest in technology and entrepreneurship. I consider myself a techpreneur at heart, though I feel I have yet to fully justify my career as an engineer by making a truly innovative contribution. My goal remains undecided, but I am committed to exploring various domains until I find the right fit.

I'm particularly motivated to address real-world problems and recognize how quickly the world is evolving with exponential advancements in technology. Automation is transforming many human tasks, and I believe that in this era, the power of an idea is stronger than ever. Even non-technical individuals can implement their ideas with the help of no-code AI tools. Iâ€™ve experimented with some of these tools in my projects, which has only reinforced my belief in the impact of ideas combined with technology.

I have foundational skills in Machine Learning and Web Development, and Iâ€™m continuously improving. Beyond technical skills, Iâ€™m dedicated to effective communication and team dynamics.
